# Django Ninja API Testing Best Practices

## Summary
- Ensure all test client requests use the correct path prefix as mounted in the main API (e.g., `/auth/`).
- Always register routers and controllers on the main API instance, not just sub-routers.
- Use TestClient(api) for all endpoint tests.
- Clear NinjaAPI._registry before each test to avoid ConfigError.
- Decorate all database-using tests with `@pytest.mark.django_db`.
- Use `/token/pair` to obtain JWT tokens for authenticated requests.
- Test endpoint paths as registered on the API, not as mounted in Django URLs.

## Actions
- If you see `Cannot resolve` errors in tests, check your test path and router mounting.
- If you see `ConfigError` about duplicate API registration, add a fixture to clear NinjaAPI._registry before each test.
- If you see database access errors, add `@pytest.mark.django_db` to your test functions.

examples:
  - input: |
      client.get("/me") # Fails if router is mounted at /auth/
    output: |
      client.get("/auth/me") # Correct if router is mounted at /auth/
  - input: |
      @pytest.mark.django_db
      def test_foo(): ...
    output: |
      # Correct: allows DB access in tests
