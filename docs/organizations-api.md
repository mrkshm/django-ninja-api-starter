# Organization API Requirements & Implementation Steps

## Requirements

1. **Organization CRUD**
   - Create, update, delete, and retrieve organizations.
   - Organizations have at least: `id`, `name`, `slug`, `created_at`, `owner` (user), and optional metadata.
2. **Membership Management**
   - Users can belong to one or more organizations.
   - Support roles (e.g., owner, admin, member).
   - Endpoints to list members, invite, join, leave, and remove users from orgs.
3. **Permissions**
   - Only authenticated users can create organizations.
   - Only org owners/admins can update/delete org or manage members.
   - Use centralized permission helper for all org-aware endpoints.
4. **API Endpoints**
   - RESTful endpoints for org and membership actions.
   - Example:
     - `POST /organizations/` (create org)
     - `GET /organizations/` (list orgs user belongs to)
     - `GET /organizations/{slug}/` (org detail)
     - `PATCH /organizations/{slug}/` (update org)
     - `DELETE /organizations/{slug}/` (delete org)
     - `GET /organizations/{slug}/members/` (list members)
     - `POST /organizations/{slug}/invite/` (invite member)
     - `POST /organizations/{slug}/join/` (join org)
     - `POST /organizations/{slug}/leave/` (leave org)
     - `POST /organizations/{slug}/remove/` (remove member)
5. **Signals/Automation**
   - Optionally auto-create org on user signup (keep as default, but allow API-based creation).
   - Send notifications/invites as needed.
6. **Extensibility**
   - Make it easy to extend org model (add metadata, billing, etc).
   - Modular: easy to remove or swap out.
7. **Documentation**
   - Document endpoints, permissions, and extension points clearly.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Design Organization & Membership Models**

   - Create `Organization` model (fields: name, slug, owner, created_at, etc).
   - Create `Membership` model (user, organization, role, joined_at, etc).

2. **Create Organization App**

   - Scaffold `organizations` Django app.
   - Register models in admin.

3. **Implement API Endpoints**

   - Use Django Ninja to create a router for org endpoints.
   - Implement CRUD and membership endpoints.
   - Use permission helper for all org-aware endpoints.

4. **Integrate with User Signup**

   - Keep auto-create org on signup as default.
   - Allow org creation via API as well.

5. **Add Signals/Notifications**

   - Signals for org creation, user invited/removed, etc.
   - Email or in-app notifications for invites.

6. **Write Tests**

   - Test org CRUD, membership actions, permissions, and edge cases.

7. **Document Usage**
   - Write clear docs on endpoints, permissions, and how to extend/replace the org module.

**Note:** This design is modular and can be included as an optional app in your starter template. Projects with custom org needs can extend or replace it as needed.
